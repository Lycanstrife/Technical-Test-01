Front End Developer Test
------------------------
You are building the front end template of a provided flat design. Take front-end.psd and convert it into a working web page. Deconstruct the design so that it works device-independently.

Functional Requirements
-----------------------
The form should validate (but data doesnâ€™t need to be stored). The template should be functional and aesthetic on all devices.

Technical Requirements
----------------------
This should be the start of an extendible project, so separation of elements and assets is the bare minimum requirement. Use images where required, but use CSS and JS where appropriate

Deliverables
------------
Please provide a public GitHub URL with suitable site structure (i.e. css, js and images in separate folders).
